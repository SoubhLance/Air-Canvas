# Air Canvas

Air Canvas is an interactive application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using a colored marker or any object with a distinctive color. The application utilizes computer vision techniques to detect the colored object and track its movement, enabling the user to draw in the air. This project is a fun way to explore the basics of image processing and computer vision using Python and OpenCV.


## Features

- Draw on a virtual canvas using a colored marker.
- Change drawing colors with a simple gesture.
- Clear the canvas with a specific gesture.
- Adjustable HSV color range for precise marker detection.
- Real-time drawing on the canvas displayed in a separate window.

## Requirements

- Python 3 {3.11.4 is used here specifically}
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Deque
